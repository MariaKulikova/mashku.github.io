# AI Assistant for Used Car Selection


</section>

<section className="section-margin">
### Context

An assistant that helps with selecting and buying a used car in Europe.
We combine the best of chatbots, classified ads, and that familiar friend who knows about cars and can give advice.
Our goal is to relieve the user from having to read a lot of reviews, articles, and browse sales listings across different platforms.
We do this work for them â€” and also guide them on prices, point out strengths and weaknesses of different cars based on their needs.

### Current Focus

Currently working on the main car selection flow for user testing.
The basic flow includes gathering requirements, recommending suitable cars, suggesting specific listings, and allowing users to save favorites.

### Start of the search

We show an input field and suggestions with the most common queries.

### Recommendation

We act as a car finder, so recommending a car is one of the main points in the user flow.
We show recommendations based on the user's request and allow them to open the car card for more details.

### Offers and favorites

The result of the selection process is a set of relevant and up-to-date listings from classifieds, filtered according to the user's requirements and location.
Users can save favorite listings to review them later.
