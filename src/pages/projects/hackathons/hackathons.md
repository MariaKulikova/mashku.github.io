### Context

We took part in the Digital Breakthrough hackathon series, where the challenge was to build a working digital product in just 48 hours. 
Our team included three developers, one QA engineer, and me as the designer. My role was to run a quick research phase, design the user interface, and prepare the project presentation for the jury. 

During the hackathon, we developed two impactful projects: Hunt U and Tovarishi — both solving real-world problems and delivering results that were recognized at the national level.

### Hunt U
  The first project, Hunt U, aimed to automate key hiring processes for companies facing a high volume of applicants. We built a functional prototype that streamlined resume filtering, skill checks, and candidate sorting. The solution focused on making life easier for recruiters while ensuring candidates were assessed fairly and efficiently. Our project was recognized for its strong practical value and advanced to the finals of Digital Breakthrough.

### Tovarichy

The second project, Tovarishi, tackled everyday logistics for students living on campus. The idea was to connect students with and without cars to help each other with deliveries—saving time and building a stronger campus community. We created a mobile single-page application that allowed users to request and respond to delivery help. The app proved both useful and usable, earning us 3rd place at the regional stage of Digital Breakthrough.
