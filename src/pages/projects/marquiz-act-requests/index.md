  # Designing the design process

<section className="section-margin">

Marquiz is a survey and lead generation platform that helps increase conversion rates and lower lead costs.

### I worked as a senior product designer

Together with the team, we launched new features and solved user problems.
For example, I worked on optimizing the work completion act request process. Many clients needed these documents for accounting purposes, but the existing process was manual and time-consuming, leading to delays and numerous support requests. I interviewed internal users, gathered requirements, turned them into a clear task, and designed an interface. As a result, we reduced the time spent on manual invoice processing.

### But my biggest and most meaningful challenge was improving the design process in the team.
At that time, all designers worked in a single Figma file. We had no structure, no metrics to evaluate design decisions. The file was too heavy, loaded slowly, and was hard to maintain ‚Äî it created friction for both designers and developers.

### What I did
I researched best practices for working in Figma as a team, and spoke with designers, developers, and marketers about their experience. Based on this, I proposed a new file structure: we split designs by user flow, I wrote clear guidelines, and helped junior designers understand components, auto-layouts, and design tokens.

### The result
<div className="columns">

üïü It became easier to keep the designs up to date. 
The structure was clearer and the files loaded faster.

ü§ù I also started regular knowledge-sharing sessions between product and marketing designers. 
This helped create a shared understanding of the product vision across design teams.

üìà We started using metrics, which allowed designers to evaluate their decisions more effectively
