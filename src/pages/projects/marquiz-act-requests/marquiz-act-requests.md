  # Designing the design process

<section className="section-margin">

Marquiz is a survey and lead generation platform that helps increase conversion rates and lower lead costs.

### I worked as a senior product designer

Together with the team, we launched new features and solved user problems.
For example, I worked on optimizing the work completion act request process. Many clients needed these documents for accounting purposes, but the existing process was manual and time-consuming, leading to delays and numerous support requests. I interviewed internal users, gathered requirements, turned them into a clear task, and designed an interface. As a result, we reduced the time spent on manual invoice processing.

### But my biggest and most meaningful challenge was improving the design process in the team.
At that time, all designers worked in a single Figma file. We had no structure, no metrics to evaluate design decisions. The file was too heavy, loaded slowly, and was hard to maintain — it created friction for both designers and developers.

### What I did
I researched best practices for working in Figma as a team, and spoke with designers, developers, and marketers about their experience. Based on this, I proposed a new file structure: we split designs by user flow, I wrote clear guidelines, and helped junior designers understand components, auto-layouts, and design tokens.

### The result
<div className="columns">

🕟 It became easier to keep the designs up to date. 
The structure was clearer and the files loaded faster.

🤝 I also started regular knowledge-sharing sessions between product and marketing designers. 
This helped create a shared understanding of the product vision across design teams.

📈 We started using metrics, which allowed designers to evaluate their decisions more effectively
